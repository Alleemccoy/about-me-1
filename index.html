        <p>My name is Tony Regalado. I was born and raised in Chicago, but currently live in Seattle. I used to be an Electrician in United States Coast Guard in my past live. I have a dog named Lemon and she's my bestie. I really love to snowboard and enjoy the outdoors. I'm also an avid PC FPS gamer and a huge nerd at heart. I have a passion for tech, computers and modifying cars. Currently, I'm building a 750 whp Subaru WRX STi and will be auto-crossing it next spring.
